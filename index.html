                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Pari (Bad Soden am Taunus, 1993) is a cultural worker, writer, musician, and singer based in Berlin with over a decade of experience in project management and arts facilitation. She holds a Bachelor of Music with a specialization in pedagogy from McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada, 2015) and a Graduate Certificate in Arts and Cultural Management from Humber College (Toronto, Canada, 2018).</p>
                    
                    <p>With a clear vision for inclusive, postmigrant, and queer spaces, Pari creates transformative experiences where marginalized voices are heard. Most recently, within just one year, she developed and implemented a program that reached more than 500 LGBTQ+ people with migration and/or refugee experiences, creating creative and accessible spaces for expression and participation. She also brings a wide range of experience from Canada, where she led a national initiative that empowered over 17,000 youth to explore careers in film, working closely with schools, filmmakers, and industry partners across the country – bringing intercultural perspectives and expertise in scaling participatory initiatives. She has worked at the Goethe-Institut Toronto and the Goethe-Institut im Exil in Berlin, contributing to the design and implementation of arts and cultural events. In fall 2023, she moderated a panel at the fluctoplasma festival on "Afghanistan's Hidden Musical Treasures," and in October 2025, she will lead her own vocal workshop as part of the 3 C's Cohort by BIWOC* Rising in Kreuzberg.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pari combines music, artistic practice, and strategic management, with expertise in partnership development, grant management, and the implementation of participatory programs in Berlin's independent arts scene. Throughout her career, she has embodied every role – as organizer, facilitator, and artist – fostering creativity and community for people who are often excluded from such spaces.</p>
